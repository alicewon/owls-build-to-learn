# Plan of action:
<br>
1. Create repository on GitHub
<br>
2. Chose a mockup (https://cssauthor.com/resources/flat-mate-free-single-page-website-design-template-psd/)
<br>
3. Add contributors to the repo (to be added send your Github username in Slack to @serhiicss)
<br>
3. Start coding

### Guidelines:
<br>
1) Please use only pure HTML/CSS (no Bootsrap or any other frameworks).
<br>
2) Please try an document your work so it could be understood by all of team members (you can leave comments in code, write a separate article or even record a video :) ).
<br>
3) We are not going to use an actual slider or a video for this page, just a placeholder

Fonts used: Roboto, Roboto Slab

The mock up consists of 3 main parts:
	• Header
	• Content body 
	• Footer

The header has a top  section with logo and an account access button

The content body is split into 4 sections:
	1. Product description
	2. Slider
	3. Rates
	4. Video

The footer has a contact form and a sub-footer.

The first thing to do is declare global rules. This means we assign CSS styles to the elements that maybe reused in the code. For example: font-family an font size of the text, colors, margins and paddings.
