# owls-build-to-learn
A Chingu Voyage Build-to-Learn team project of coding a website from a mock up.

# Team:
@alicewon
<br>
@irmattg
<br>
@mcne65
<br>
@serhiicss

# Plan of action:
<br>
1. Create repository on GitHub
<br>
2. Chose a mockup
<br>
3. Add contributors to the repo
<br>
3. Start coding

### Guidelines:
<br>
1) Please use only pure HTML/CSS (no Bootsrap or any other frameworks).
<br>
2) Please try an document your work so it could be understood by all of team members (you can leave comments in code, write a separate article or even record a video :) ).
<br>
3) We are not going to use an actual slider or a video for this page, just a placeholder.
<br>
4)
