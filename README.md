# Plan of action:
<br>
1. Create repository on GitHub
<br>
2. Chose a mockup (https://cssauthor.com/resources/flat-mate-free-single-page-website-design-template-psd/)
<br>
3. Add contributors to the repo (to be added send your Github username in Slack to @serhiicss)
<br>
3. Start coding

### Guidelines:
<br>
1) Please use only pure HTML/CSS (no Bootsrap or any other frameworks).
<br>
2) Please try an document your work so it could be understood by all of team members (you can leave comments in code, write a separate article or even record a video :) ).
<br>
3) We are not going to use an actual slider or a video for this page, just a placeholder.
<br>
4)
